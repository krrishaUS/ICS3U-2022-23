/******************************************************************************
 * A DoubleArraySequence is a collection of double numbers.
 * The sequence can have a special "current element," which is specified and
 * accessed through four methods that are not available in the sequence class
 * (start, getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
 *
 * @note
 *       (1) The capacity of one a sequence can change after it's created, but
 *       the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the
 *       machine. The constructor, addAfter,
 *       addBefore, clone,
 *       and concatenation will result in an
 *       OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted.
 *       <p>
 *       (2) A sequence's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer
 *       2,147,483,647
 *       (Integer.MAX_VALUE). Any attempt to create a larger capacity
 *       results in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow.
 *
 * @note
 *       This file contains only blank implementations ("stubs")
 *       because this is a Programming Project for my students.
